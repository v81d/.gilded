### Full Installation

1. Backup your current configuration files if necessary.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config_backup
cp -r ~/.config/* ~/.config_backup/
```

2. Clone this repository and open it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v81d/.gilded.git
cd .gilded
```

3. Install any necessary fonts, themes, icons, or packages mentioned earlier.

```bash
sudo apt install <packages>  # Debian/Ubuntu-based
sudo dnf install <packages>  # Fedora/RHEL-based
sudo pacman -S <packages>  # Arch/Manjaro-based
sudo zypper install <packages>  # openSUSE-based
sudo apk add <packages>  # Alpine Linux
sudo emerge <packages>  # Gentoo
```

4. Copy the configuration files from the repository to the `~/.config` folder. Create it if it does not exist yet.

```bash
cp -r .config/* ~/.config
```

5. Reboot your system to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

6. Thoroughly review your configuration files and adjust settings as needed.

> Make sure to change paths and file directories to align with your setup.

## üîã Battery Charge Threshold (Integration with Rofi)

I included this service here in case anyone would like to use it. Below are the instructions to install.

### Installation

This service will automatically set the battery charge threshold to a specified value when the system boots up. It is only compatible with `systemd`.

Follow these steps in the `.gilded` directory you created earlier.

1. Copy the service file and configuration.

```bash
sudo cp etc/systemd/system/battery-charge-threshold.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp etc/default/battery_charge_threshold /etc/default/
```

2. Edit the configuration file to set your preferred charge threshold.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/battery_charge_threshold
```

3. Enable and start the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now battery-charge-threshold.service
```

4. Verify it's working.

```bash
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
```

> **Note**: This feature requires kernel support for battery charge thresholds and may not work on all hardware. Make sure the battery path above is correct and adjust any scripts if necessary.

## ü™´ Power-Saving Tools

Below is a list of power-saving tools that I personally use to keep my power usage low.

| Package | Description |
|-|-|
| **power-profiles-daemon** | A background service that manages system-wide power settings dynamically. Allows users and applications to switch between predefined power profiles (performance, balanced, and power-saver). |
| **thermald** | A daemon that monitors and controls system temperatures to prevent overheating. |

These two packages brought my power usage from about 17.0 watts to 12 watts idle. After several months of tinkering, however, I also discovered that the following kernel parameters can also significantly boost battery life:

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **pcie_aspm=force** | Forces ASPM to be enabled even if BIOS disables it. Saves power during low activity, but can break devices on buggy firmware/hardware. |
| **pcie_aspm.policy=powersupersave** | Controls PCIe ASPM policy via the kernel's module parameter (sysfs lever) at boot. Setting it to powersupersave enables the most aggressive power-saving mode. |

These kernel settings decreased by idle power usage from about 11.7 watts to 7.5 watts idle, which is a massive boost in terms of battery life (around 5.5 hours to nearly 9 hours idle).
If you plan to use these, please do so with caution. Remember to test these temporarily before you apply them permanently.
* The `pcie_aspm=force` and `pcie_aspm.policy=powersupersave` kernel parameters may be risky on older hardware, as some PCIe devices (especially older or cheap Wi-Fi cards, NVMe SSDs, or certain USB controllers) do not handle ASPM correctly, even if they claim to support it.
